## 3.0

- first deploy of v3; everything as below
- [additional release notes](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net/blob/main/docs/3_0.md)

## v3.0.0-alpha

- **breaking change** if you are using `new ProtoReader(...)` - you must now use `ProtoReader.Create(...)`
- **breaking change** by necessity, `ProtoBuf.Serializer+TypeResolver` has moved to `ProtoBuf.Serializer`; this is a rarely used API, but comsumers will need to be recompiled against the new type
- **breaking change** - mapped enum values are no longer supported; all enums are treated as pass-thru, in line with "proto3" semantics
- **breaking change** - dynamic typing (i.e. storing the `Type` metadata) and reference-tracking (`AsReference`, `AsReferenceDefault`, `DynamicType`) are not implemented/supported; this is partly due to doubts over whether the features are adviseable, and partly over confidence in testing all the scenarios (it takes time; that time hasn't get happened); feedback is invited
- **breaking change** - non-generic list-like APIs like `IList` or `ICollection` are no longer supported; there is a new API for processing custom collection types

- new state-based reader/writer API (works with streams, buffers, etc)
- entire new custom serializer API
- new `CreateForAssembly(...)` API (various overloads) for working with precompiled (at runtime) type models (faster than `RuntimeTypeModel`, but less flexible)

Some features are currently incomplete; this may restrict usage for some scenarios:

- serialization callbacks on inheritance models are currently only supported at the root type; workaround: `virtual` / `override`
- tuple-based types and types with surrogates cannot currently be used in inheritance chains - mostly because I need to figure out what that even *means*
- null-item retention in lists/arrays is not currently implemented
- custom default types for collection initializers are not yet implemented; a simple workaround is to initialize the collection in the type

There are some additional changes that are *technically* breaks, but which are simply bizarre things that probably
never should have been allowed; these changes should not impact most people!

- it is no longer valid to attempt to configure `object`
- it is no longer valid to define an inheritance involving value-types
- undeclared inheritance base-types are no longer supported; meaning: if you serialize a `Foo : FooBase` **as a `FooBase`**, but only tell the serializer about `Foo` (never mentioning `FooBase`), it will fail
- all APIs that take `int key` referring to `Type` are deprecated; user code should not be directly using these APIs, so no impact is expected
- the `TypeModel` API surface (for implementing custom models) has changed; user code should not be directly using these APIs, so no impact is expected
- the default .proto syntax has been changed from `Proto2` to `Proto3`; if this is a problem, either specify it explicitly, or there is a global option for the default syntax

Other changes:

- in line with the Google implementation, the serializer now optimally chooses when to use "packed" encoding, rather than taking the user too literally
- empty lists/arrays are no longer serialized (as empty payloads) when "packed" (they aren't serialized when not "packed", so this improves consistency)
- as a consequence of the above, the "setter" may not be invoked (to an empty array) when previously it might have been; this again is consistent with how non-"packed" works
- common stacks (`Stack<T>`, `ConcurrentStack<T>`) now preserve order correctly

- critical bug fix [#256](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net/issues/256) - length-based readers are failing; if you are using 2.2.0, please update as soon as possible (this bug was introduced in 2.2.0)
- fix #241 - check all callback parameters (signature validation)
- removed `[Obsolete]` markers left in place during 64-bit updates

- optimized encoding of packed fixed-length primitives (in particular, arrays)
