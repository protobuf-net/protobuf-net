# What is protobuf-net?

protobuf-net is a .NET library that implements the Protocol Buffers wire format, providing high performance binary reliable cross-platform serialization. It primarily targets a "code first" approach, which contrasts to the schema-first approach more common to Protocol Buffers,
but which makes it really easy to work with idiomatic .NET types, including pre-existing types.
