=== Introduction ===

This is a sample WCF client/server to illustrate the potential
performance benefit of protocol buffers for data transit, and
how protobuf-net enables protocol buffers on your regular .NET types.

We're mainly interested in large payloads; for small payloads latency
in the performance bottleneck. This demo transfers all orders/lines
from the Northwind database.

Separate investigations (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-net/) show
that this data is (not including WCF overheads):

DataContractSerializer: 736,574 bytes
protobuf-net: 133,010 bytes

So we should be looking for protobuf-net to take about 18% of the
time of regular WCF usage.

=== First, The Results ===

(512 broadband over VPN, moderate power laptop)

Local server, with MTOM; 75 roundtrips:
  Foo: 14,220ms, Bar: 4,710ms (33.1%)

Remote server, without MTOM; 5 roundtrips:
  Foo: 232,508ms, Bar: 47,172ms (20.3%)

Remote server, with MTOM; 5 roundtrips:
  Foo: 229,405ms, Bar: 35,659ms (15.5%)

Clearly this represents a *significant* space saving. Obviously the use-case
is exaggerated, but it illustrates the point: for moderate size messages you
can save a lot of time by using a slimmer serialization.

Note that this really boils down to transferring 7Mb vs 1Mb; we have met
(and even exceeded) our target performance of taking 18% of the time.

=== The Server ===

The server is an ASP.NET Web Application Project that uses LINQ-to-SQL
to talk to a Northwind database on the local (server) machine
(such as SQL Server 2005 Express Edition). The data is a regular
"dbml" setup. There is also a WCF server (.svc) that publishes this
data via the INWindService interface.

=== The WCF Service ===

This interface has methods to load data (from the database), and to
"roundtrip" data - i.e. it simply accepts the data from the client
and returns it to the client without any processing (this is to
allow us to test our data transfer performance without any other
variables).

The methods are duplicated; the "Foo" methods are regular WCF style;
the "Bar" methods are *identical* except they also declare a
behavior: [ProtoBuf.ServiceModel.ProtoBehavior]

This behavior is detected by WCF, and is used to replace the default
DataContractSerializer for a protobuf-net serializer instead.

=== The Client ===

The client is a winforms application that uses WCF to consume data
from the WCF service. The proxy classes were generated via "scvutil",
and have been modified only to include the custom behavior on the "Bar"
methods.

=== Using The App ===

The app has 3 buttons and 2 options;

"Foo" requests the data (once) via regular WCF; no timing is performed
but the data is presented for the user to investigate.

"Bar" requests the data (once) via using the protobuf-net behavior;
again, no timing is performed; it is just to prove it works.

"Mtom" enables / disables MTOM on the wire. MTOM allows binary data to
be transferred without base-64 encoding, which is useful since protobuf-net
is a binary formatter.

"Remote" switches between a local server (same machine) and a remote server,
as defined in app.config. This can be used to illustrate the performance
over different links.

"Stress" does a number of roundtrips of the data (as defined by the numeric
control) using both the regular WCF and protobuf-net approaches. The results
are then summarised in the title bar.
